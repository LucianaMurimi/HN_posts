# Hacker News Posts
Hacker News is a site where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

This project seeks to illustrate how to work with datasets containing time with the main objectives being to find out:
- Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
- Do posts created at a certain times receive more comments on average?

### Dataset
The dataset is obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts.
